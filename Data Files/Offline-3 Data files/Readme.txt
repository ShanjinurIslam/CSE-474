Attached please find the data files for Channel equalization. 
Please note that the test file may be changed during evaluation. 
Assume that each received value will be dependent on only two transmitted bits,
however, the coefficients (impulse values that change the transmitted bits) 
and the noise parameter (assume Gaussin noise) must be changed. 
decision will also be assumed to be dependent on two received values.
