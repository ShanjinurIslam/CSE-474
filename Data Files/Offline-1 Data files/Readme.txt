Implement Basic, Reward Punishment and pocket perceptron for two classes:
	1. Fine tune the weight vector for the data given in train files
	2. Using the weight predict samples of test files and record accuracy
	3. Use pocket perceptron for linearly non separable data
	
Implement Kesler Reconstruction for multi classes
